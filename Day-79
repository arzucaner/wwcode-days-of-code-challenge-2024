Question:

Ruby and Javascript let you re-open classes so you can add new functionalities to existing classes and objects.

To demonstrate this, you'll have to add a new method (called my_new_method in Ruby or myNewMethod in JS / Coffeescript) into the String class that simply calls the upcase method (toUpperCase() in JS / Coffeescript), so that:

returns

"ABC"

Solution:

//Re-open the class String and add the "myNewMethod" method.
String.prototype.myNewMethod = function() {
  return this.toUpperCase();
};

console.log("abc".myNewMethod());
