Question:

This is a rather simple but interesting kata. Try to solve it using logic. The shortest solution can be fit into one line.

Task
The point is that a natural number N (1 <= N <= 10^9) is given. You need to write a function which finds the number of natural numbers not exceeding N and not divided by any of the numbers [2, 3, 5].

Example
Let's take the number 5 as an example:

1 - doesn't divide integer by 2, 3, and 5
2 - divides integer by 2
3 - divides integer by 3
4 - divides integer by 2
5 - divides integer by 5
Answer: 1

because only one number doesn't divide integer by any of 2, 3, 5

Solution:

function realNumbers(n) {
    const primes = [2, 3, 5];
    let result = n;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < (1 << primes.length); i++) {
        let divisor = 1;
        let bits = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < primes.length; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j)) {
                bits++;
                divisor *= primes[j];
            }
        }
        if (bits === 0) continue;
        
        if (bits % 2 === 1) {
            result -= Math.floor(n / divisor);
        } else {
            result += Math.floor(n / divisor);
        }
    }
