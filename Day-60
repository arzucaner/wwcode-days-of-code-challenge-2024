Question:

Complete the function that takes an array of words.

You must concatenate the nth letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string, where n is the position of the word in the list.

For example:

["yoda", "best", "has"]  -->  "yes"
  ^        ^        ^
  n=0     n=1     n=2

  Solution:

  function nthChar(words) {
  return words.map((word, index) => word.charAt(index)).join('');
}
