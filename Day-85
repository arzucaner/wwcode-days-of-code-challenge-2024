Question:

In my simple RPG, every character will be created with the object-constructor: Character.

var balthazaar = new Character('Balthazaar', 20);
                        // Balthazaar will be his name
                        // 20 will be his opness (as Over-Poweredness)
I did the best of my haxxing magic, but it seems I've got problems:

After creating him, my poor little hero's attacks seems to miss the magic of randomness. (The first fight with that stupid rat didn't go too well...)
balthazaar.attack // should RETURN 20 + ~~(Math.random()*20) + 1
                  // (maybe it should be a function)
                  // sadly, now it's always the same for me,
                  // somehow that d20 won't roll more than once
                  // (d20 is a 20 sided dice)
After defeating that rat, I want to be able to raise his "overpoweredness-factor", thus modifying his min/max attack capabilities.
balthazaar.opness++
balthazaar.attack // should RETURN 21 + ~~(Math.random()*20) + 1
                  // tried cheating with it to beat that rat, but it doesn't work
Please help my Hero kill that rat, and become more Op!

Solution: 

function Character(name, opness) {
    this.name = name;
    this.opness = opness;
}

Character.prototype.attack = function() {
    return this.opness + Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1;
}

var balthazaar = new Character('Balthazaar', 20);

console.log(balthazaar.attack()); 

balthazaar.opness++;

console.log(balthazaar.attack());
