Question:

Peter lives on a hill, and he always moans about the way to his home. "It's always just up. I never get a rest". But you're pretty sure that at least at one point Peter's altitude doesn't rise, but fall. To get him, you use a nefarious plan: you attach an altimeter to his backpack and you read the data from his way back at the next day.

Task
You're given a list of compareable elements:

heights = [h1, h2, h3, …, hn]
Your job is to check whether for any x all successors are greater or equal to x.

isMonotone([1,2,3]) == true
isMonotone([1,1,2]) == true
isMonotone([1])     == true
isMonotone([3,2,1]) == false
isMonotone([3,2,2]) == false
If the list is empty, Peter has probably removed your altimeter, so we cannot prove him wrong and he's still right:

isMonotone([])     == True

Solution:

var isMonotone = function(arr) {
  return arr.every((value, index) => index === arr.length - 1 || value <= arr[index + 1]);
};
