Question:

In my "getQuotes" function, I am trying to extract only the quotes from a string.

#Example

getQuotes('"example quote #1" some text "example quote #2"'); 
// should return ["\"example quote #1\"","\"example quote #2\""]
However, my test results are not as expected. can you find out what I did wrong?

Solution:

var reg = /"([^"]*?)"/g;

function getQuotes(string) {
  return string.match(reg) || []; 
}
