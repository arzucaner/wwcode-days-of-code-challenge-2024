Question:

Chingel was creating a function which would return true if the input followed this time format 14-10-2016 01:12 and false otherwise. But looks like he has messed it up. Could you help him out? Please!

Rank and Upvote if you liked it :D

P.S.- Random tests to be added soon.

Solution:

function isItBugged(code){
    return /^(\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4} \d{2}:\d{2})$/.test(code);
}
