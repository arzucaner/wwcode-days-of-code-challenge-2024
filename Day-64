Question:

The song sheets have been dropped in the snow and the lines of each verse have become all jumbled up.

Task
You have to write a comparator function which can sort the lines back into their correct order, otherwise Christmas will be cancelled!

Reminder: Below is what the final verse should look like

On the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me
12 drummers drumming,
11 pipers piping, 
10 lords a leaping, 
9 ladies dancing, 
8 maids a milking,
7 swans a swimming, 
6 geese a laying, 
5 golden rings, 
4 calling birds,
3 French hens, 
2 turtle doves and 
a partridge in a pear tree.

Solution:

var comparator = function(a, b) {
  const order = [
    "12 drummers drumming,",
    "11 pipers piping,",
    "10 lords a leaping,",
    "9 ladies dancing,",
    "8 maids a milking,",
    "7 swans a swimming,",
    "6 geese a laying,",
    "5 golden rings,",
    "4 calling birds,",
    "3 French hens,",
    "2 turtle doves and",
    "a partridge in a pear tree."
  ];

  return order.indexOf(a) - order.indexOf(b);
};
